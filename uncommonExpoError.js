This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and you encounter unexpected behavior or crashes related to the underlying native code (iOS or Android) that Expo builds upon.  The Expo CLI itself might not always provide very specific error messages, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause.  For example, a build might fail without clear indication of which part of your app's native code is causing the issue.
