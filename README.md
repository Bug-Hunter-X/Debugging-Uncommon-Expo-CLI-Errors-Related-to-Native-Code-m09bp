# Debugging Uncommon Expo CLI Errors

This repository demonstrates troubleshooting difficult-to-diagnose errors in Expo CLI projects.  These errors often originate from the underlying native iOS/Android code and manifest as unexpected crashes or build failures with minimal information from the Expo CLI itself.

The `uncommonExpoError.js` file contains a simulated scenario where an uncommon error might occur. The `uncommonExpoErrorSolution.js` file provides potential debugging strategies and solutions.

## Strategies for Debugging

1. **Examine Native Build Logs:** The most crucial step is to thoroughly examine the build logs generated by Expo for both iOS and Android. These logs will contain far more detailed error messages than the Expo CLI's high-level output.
2. **Isolate the Problem:** If possible, try to isolate the specific part of your code that is causing the problem by commenting sections out or simplifying your application to identify the minimal reproducible example.
3. **Check Native Dependencies:** Ensure all your native dependencies (if any) are correctly installed and compatible with your current Expo SDK version. Inconsistent or outdated native libraries can lead to bizarre issues.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, simply cleaning the build cache and rebuilding your project from scratch can resolve transient problems.
5. **Use Debugging Tools:** Utilize debugging tools within your IDE or Expo's debugging capabilities to step through your code and identify potential issues at runtime.
6. **Consult the Expo Community:** Engage with the Expo community through forums or their support channels to seek help if you're still unable to resolve the issue.  Provide as much detail as possible, including the full native build logs.
